    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The objective of this website is to allow our patrons, along with our newly, inquiring, and prospective customers to be able to access our information and resources center to better aid them in their decision-making process when booking our tours and packages. This will alleviate the need for our customers to book through third-party agencies and entities alike—at a more costly rate, hence giving them access to a better deal for their money; which will in turn boost the company’s revenue and overall customer satisfaction.<br>
    <br>Here at WWR, we want all our customers to be satisfied ultimately. Allowing our customers to access our website directly, gives us a chance to build and improve our customers' relationships by building trust and giving them the ability to leave feedback as we seek ways to improve their overall experiences. We also aim to encourage customers to share their positive experiences, through testimonials on our website, where their comments can be highlighted; showing their thoughts and experience.<br>
    <br>Our platform will allow customers to easily navigate our website showcasing scenic imagery of some of the various tours and excursions that are offered as part of our packages, which include our breathtaking rainforest waterfalls and parks listed amongst our famous white water rafting activities that keep our patrons returning!</p>
